# Credit Card Fraud Detection
Based amount and time of the credit card transactions made, find if there are any fraudulent transactions being made.
## Counting the number of transactions per card holder.
  - On counting the number of transactions per card holder one card holders have unusally high number of transactions as compared to the rest of the data.
  - Just based on this information I cannot predict if there is any fraudulent transactions or not. Need more history and benchmarks

## Counting the top 100 hundered transactions made and analyze if there is any fradulent transactions.
  - Based on this sampling of the data Transaction ID #774 seems to be fraudulent as this sticks out because of the round numher as amount is $100 even, given no other transaction is like that.

## Transaction that are less than $2 made every hour, see which hour could potentialy be at risk of fraud
  - The hour between 4AM-5AM and 7PM-8PM seems to have more transaction than rest of the hour, hence more risk of fraudulent activity.

## The following merchants have more transactions that are less than $2
  - Wood-Ramirez
  - Baker Inc
  - Hood-Phillips
  - Walker, Deleon and Wolf
  - Greene-Wood
